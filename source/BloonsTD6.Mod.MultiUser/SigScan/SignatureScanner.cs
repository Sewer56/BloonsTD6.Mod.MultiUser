                There is an optimization going on in here apart from manual inlining which is why
                this function is a tiny mess of more goto statements than it seems necessary.
                Basically, it is considerably faster to reference a variable on the stack, than it is on the heap.
            
                This is because the compiler can address the stack bound variable relative to the current stack pointer,
                as opposing to having to dereference a pointer and then take an offset from the result address.
                
                This ends up being considerably faster, which is important in a scenario where we are entirely CPU bound.
